# Predicting Startup Success: A Deep Neural Network Approach

In this project, I have created a binary classification model using a deep neural network to predict whether an applicant will become a successful business if funded by Alphabet Soup. This model is based on historical data of over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. We have created and evaluated three different deep neural network models for the binary classification task. The models differ in terms of optimization techniques.

## Installation Guide

Open your terminal and run the command:

```python
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

Clone the repository and Launch Jupyter Notebook by executing the following command in your terminal:

```python
  jupyter lab
```

In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project directory and open the venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb file.

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to prepare the data, build the deep learning models, and evaluate the models' performance for comparison..
